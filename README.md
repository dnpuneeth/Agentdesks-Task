# Agentdesks-Task
Pasrse Json file and display it in Table format. Also provide search option.

Problem Statement:
There are more than 4k items in the JSON.You can use any javascript framework to develop this task. If you can implement using ES6 standard it would be appreciated.

Functional Requirements : 
List the contacts and the details in a table format. The challenge would be to optimally utilize the cells/divs and data and to reuse them. The table should scroll smoothly without lags. 
Load 50 number of items from the JSON on initially load
We should be able to search the contacts in a search box (at least by name. More options more brownie points). It should be able to search and filter as you type in the chars in the search box.

Solution:
* Implemented using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and JavaScript(Jquery).
* Search facilitated with all options(first names, last names, emails and agency names)
* Added pagination to limit the table items on initial load and to view next set of items in table.
